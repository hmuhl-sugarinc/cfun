Example C code and exercises

This is a collection of small C programs used as examples and exercises
to teach some introductory low level computer science concepts. Most of
these programs have errors and undefined behavior. This is intentional.
As such, these should not be used as examples of good C code. Rather,
these programs are vehicles for discussing how a computer accesses
memory, and how mistakes like buffer overflows lead to security problems
and other errors.
